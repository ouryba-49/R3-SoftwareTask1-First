# R3-SoftwareTask1-First
I was not able to program a code that takes in binary coded decimal from the analog pin of the arduino and send it to the CD4511 which converts the 4bits received from the analog input pin to decimals, so that for each combination of those bits a corresponding LED on the 7 segment will turn on or off and controlling two of these by the potentiometer.  I tried learning a bit and understood the logic but with no solid previous experience with coding so I was not able to catch up quickly with the syntax of the software. 
I tried to understand how the individual parts are supposed to work so I connected them with to make the 7 segement displays turn on based on the position of the wiper in the potentiometer.
